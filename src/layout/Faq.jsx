      <h1>FAQS</h1>
      <h3>Does Wild Wind Tattoo take walk ins?</h3>
      <p>
        We try to accommodate everyone and if we have open time we will take
        walk ins. You can always call the shop the day you are thinking of
        coming in and we can let you know who is available for walk ins. As long
        as the tattoo isnâ€™t a larger custom piece that needs a lot of prep time
        we will take care of you. Please remember walk ins are always first come
        first served and there is always the possibility of some wait time if
        you do not have an appointment.
      </p>
      <h3>What is the shop minimum?</h3>
      <p>
        Our minimum is $100 and the final price of a tattoo is always determined
        in person
      </p>
      <h3>Is the shop cash only?</h3>
      <p>
        No, we also accept all major credit cards as well as cash. We DO NOT
        accept checks, Venmo, Square Cash, Chase Quick Pay, etc.
      </p>
      <h3>Do you give price quotes through email or over the phone?</h3>
      <p>
        We can not give a valid price quote through email or over the phone. We
        may give a general price range but that is only a loose estimate. We
        cannot determine the price of your tattoo without discussing size,
        detail and the location of your tattoo with you in person.
      </p>
      <h3>What is the wait time for getting an appointment?</h3>
      <p>
        Every artist schedules at their own pace but typically we can fit in
        appointments in a two to three week time frame.
      </p>
      <h3>How can I make an appointment?</h3>
      <p>
        {/*add link to contact page*/}Filling out our contact form is a great
        starting point. Please provide some general info and we will message you
        back in 1-3 business days. Feel free to send reference photos and
        describe the design you are looking to get tattooed. All tattoo
        appointments require deposits, once a date and time is worked out you
        will be directed to our deposit form to lock in your appointment.
      </p>
      <h3>Do I have to leave a deposit to make an appointment?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, we take a $60 deposit for every appointment. Once the date and time
        of your appoinment has been worked out you will be directed to our
        deposit form. Your appointmnet is not made final until your deposit has
        been recieved. The deposit comes off the price of your tattoo when you
        get it done. If your tattoo takes multiple sittings the deposit will
        come off the final session of your tattoo.
      </p>
      <h3>Can I see my tattoo design before my appointment?</h3>
      <p>
        We do not email out or show drawings to clients prior to their
        appointments, we feel client and artist collaboration while ,aking
        design changes is always best to be done in person. Drawings are always
        ready for you the you come in to get your tattoo. We block out enough
        time for your appointment to allow for any revisions or changes you may
        want to make to your tattoo design on the day of your appointment.
      </p>
      <h3>What is your cancellation policy?</h3>
      <p>
        If you give 24 hour notice to cancel your appointment we will still
        honor your $60 deposit. If you cancel with less than a 24 hour notice
        you forfeit your deposit and may be asked to drop another deposit to
        reschedule an appointment.
