      <h1>FAQS</h1>
      <h3>Does Wild Wind Tattoo accept walk-ins?</h3>
      <p>
        WWT strives to accommodate all clients and may accept walk-ins if
        openings are available. We recommend calling ahead on the day you plan
        to visit to check availability. Walk-ins are ideal for smaller tattoos
        that require minimal preparation. Please note that walk-ins are
        first-come, first-served, and there may be a wait if you donâ€™t have an
        appointment.
      </p>
      <h3>What is the shop minimum?</h3>
      <p>
        Our shop minimum is $100. The final price of any tattoo will be
        determined in person based on the design.
      </p>
      <h3>Is the shop cash only?</h3>
      <p>
        No, we accept all major credit cards and cash. Please note that we do
        not accept checks, Venmo, Square Cash, Chase Quick Pay, or similar
        payment methods.
      </p>
      <h3>Do you give price quotes via email or phone?</h3>
      <p>
        We do not provide valid price quotes via email or phone. We can offer a
        general price range, but this is only an estimate. The final price
        depends on the tattoo's size, detail, and placement, which we'll discuss
        during your in-person visit.
      </p>
      <h3>What is the wait time for getting an appointment?</h3>
      <p>
        Wait times vary as each artist manages their own schedule, but
        typically, we schedule appointments within a two to three-week
        timeframe.
      </p>
      <h3>How can I make an appointment?</h3>
      <p>
        {/*add link to contact page*/}Begin booking by filling out our contact
        form with basic information about your desired tattoo. We will respond
        within 1-3 business days. After an artist responds to your request, you
        can email them with reference photos and a design description. All
        tattoo appointments require a deposit. Once a date and time are agreed
        upon, you will be directed to complete our deposit form to secure your
        appointment.
      </p>
      <h3>Do I have to leave a deposit to make an appointment?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, a $60 deposit is required for each appointment. Once the date and
        time are arranged, you will be directed to our deposit form. Your
        appointment is not confirmed until we receive your deposit. This deposit
        will be deducted from the cost of your tattoo when it is completed, or
        if your tattoo requires multiple sessions, it will be deducted during
        the last session.
      </p>
      <h3>Can I see my tattoo design before my appointment?</h3>
      <p>
        We do not send out or show tattoo designs via email before appointments,
        as we believe the best collaboration between client and artist occurs in
        person. Your design will be ready for review on the day of your
        appointment, and we will set aside enough time to make any revisions or
        changes you might want.
      </p>
      <h3>What is your cancellation policy?</h3>
      <p>
        If you cancel your appointment with at least 24 hours notice, we will
        honor your $60 deposit for a future appointment. Cancellations made with
        less than 24 hours notice will result in the forfeiture of your deposit.
        To reschedule, you may be required to place another deposit.
